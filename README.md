# Electric Blanket Controller 

## About The Project

An excellent way to stay warm while camping/overlanding on a tight electrical energy budget is with a 12V electric blanket. With a blanket such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N21MI0Z) under a sleeping bag, you can stay fairly warm. However, these blankets don't typically come with temperature control and you can easily overheat a couple hours after power on. In addition to it being uncomfortable, there's power being wasted here to achieve a comfortable temperature. The electric blanket controller uses a MOSFET as a switch to apply a duty cycle to the power coming into the blanket, giving users a choice between different levels of heat. 

## Goals

- [ ] Efficient - as most users are using 12V electric blankets off grid, it's important that the controller doesn't dissipate much power
- [ ] Easy to use - no modifications to the blankets or car power port, plug and play
- [ ] Replicable - so more overlanders can stop overheating with these blankets and save energy

## Milestones

- [ x ] Find appropriate hardware for controller
- [ x ] Test hardware and find duty cycle
- [ x ] Create PCB 
- [ x ] Write firmware
- [ x  ] Test firmware

## Getting Started

Details for software toolchain and installation will be included here. Hardware information will also be included.
